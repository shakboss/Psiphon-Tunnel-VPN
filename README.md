[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psiphon)  
* Psiphon is a free and open-source Internet censorship circumvention tool that uses a combination of secure communication and obfuscation technologies, such as a VPN, SSH, and a Web proxy. Psiphon is a centrally managed and geographically diverse network of thousands of proxy servers, using a performance-oriented, single- and multi-hop routing architecture.

[Jon Watson](https://www.comparitech.com/blog/vpn-privacy/using-psiphon-guide/) 
Specifically, Psiphon:
*  Uses (injects) ads to support the service which use cookies and web beacons
* Occasionally records additional usage data which will be disclosed on its Privacy Bulletin
* Shares access data with its partners so they can see how often their sites are visited and from where
* Runs all of the Psiphon servers itself, although the code is open source and available on GitHub
